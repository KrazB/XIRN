Create Classification_model_for_Init_Datar_
In this file, we are working on Init_Data to find out the best fit machine learning model to segment according Name and Code based on different text variables. 

The process of this particular workflow is:
- Getting to know the data description, purpose and context, etc
- Data exploration
- Cleaning data ( filling null values, drop severe null columns, clean text to handle punctuation,etc)
- Analysing overlap columns (due to its high repetitiveness among variables) then merge the overlapped features
- Splitting the given dataset into Testing dataset and Training dataset with 2 target classification
- Vectorising the text coumnd on training dataset
- Models Training
- Fine-tuning the model (to be added)
- Final Evaluation then find the Best Model
- Performance Report (to be added)
- Deployment (tobe added)
